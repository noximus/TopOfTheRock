How to use this file:
-----------------------------------------
Simply drop the movieclip named ScrollingMenu onto your stage, all ActionScript is self-contained in the ScrollingMenu movieclip.


To customize your menu:
-----------------------------------------

Go inside the ScrollingMenu movieclip and view the ActionScript on the Actions layer.

1) To define the total number of buttons you would like to have, change the number which totalBttns equals to.

2) To define number of buttons visible at any time change the number which showBttns equals to.

3) To have custom names for each button, remove /*/ and repeat the code for the total number of buttons

For Example:

menu_mc.bttn_mc1.menuName = "Home"
menu_mc.bttn_mc2.menuName = "About us"
menu_mc.bttn_mc3.menuName = "Services"

Repeat for the total number of buttons.

4) To link the buttons to frame labels on your stage, go the bttn_mc Movieclip and view actions on the Bttn layer. Remove the comment "//"

For Example:
_root.gotoAndStop(menuName);

menuName would be a frame label on your stage.

Alternatively you could link to a target movieclip on your stage.
For Example:
_root.content_mc.gotoAndStop(menuName);

This will link to frame labels within the content_mc MovieClip which is on your stage.
