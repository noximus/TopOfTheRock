				<q><para>Q: What is the Beam Walk?</para></q>
				<a><para>A: The famous photo Lunchtime immortalized the construction workers who built Rockefeller Center

				of their world without the risk. In our Pre-Show, we have a simulated walk across a steel beam. The Beam Walk 
				was made famous by Al Roker, the Today Show personality who demonstrated it in a live broadcast on our opening 
				day.</para></a>
